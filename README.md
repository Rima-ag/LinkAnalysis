# LinkAnalysis

This project's main purpose is to analyse twitter data and extract insights from the data using the PageRank Algorithm.

# Preprocessing

The data (out.munmun_twitter_social) was downloaded from : https://github.com/DarthMax/Graph-Centrality-Measures/tree/master/flink/data

It represents who follows whom.

In order to run the PageRank Algorithm on that data, the file was preprocessed using the main.py file to transform it into the "in" file.
